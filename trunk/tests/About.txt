= ExM Parser Test Suite

== Overview

The official documentation is at:

https://sites.google.com/site/exmproject/development/parser---usage#TOC-Test-suite

We compile each Swift script to the corresponding Tcl script, then run
Turbine on it.

Use +run-tests.zsh+ to run the tests.  This automates the following
simplified command lines:
----
stc 100-test.swift 100-test.tcl
turbine -n 3 100-test.tcl
----

This creates stc logs, intermediate code, and output files.

== Numbering

The tests are numbered for lexical sorting by shell glob.

000::       Script fragments, noops, assert()s
100::       Basic function calls, errors
200::       Conditionals, recursion, expressions
300::       Arrays, structs
400::       For loops
500::       Types
        560: files
        580: foreach
        590: blobs
600::       User builtins, interesting CPP uses
700::       STC standard library
        700: strings
        710: argc/argv
        730: stdio
        780: MPE
        790: External scripting languages (R, Python)
800::       Error outputs
900::       Apps??? Formerly advanced constructs
        900: More for loops- move to 400?
        910: iterate - move to 400?
        920: wait() {}
        940: Globals
        950: Stats
        960: Updateables
        970: PIPS snippets
        980: RDCEP snippets

== Clean

Use ./clean.sh to clean up files created by the test suite
