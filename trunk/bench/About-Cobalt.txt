Cobalt does not properly handle environment variable values
that contain spaces.  This creates problems for TURBINE_USER_LIB,
which relies on the space-separated TCLLIBPATH

The workaround is to change the package path in the Tcl.  After
compiling the *.swift to *.tcl; manually append to the list auto_path
before doing the package require, as shown:

lappend auto_path /gpfs/home/wozniak/proj/stc/bench/util
package require bench ...
