How to Contribute to Swift/T

Swift/T is an interesting project to work on if you are interested in
any subset of the following areas:

* compilers
** language-language translators
** parser generators (ANTLR)
** data flow languages and run time technologies

* languages for big computer systems:
** high performance computing
** cloud computing
** distributed computing
** MPI
** master-worker systems
** alternatives to MapReduce

* libraries, frameworks, and abstractions
** dataflow libraries for common tasks
** environments for rapid prototyping

Swift/T is based on the following key technologies:

* ANTLR for parsing, with a Java-based compiler
* Tcl as a run time implementation language
* MPI for communication
* ADLB for master-worker task distribution
* A large amount of Tcl run time libraries and user libraries
* A small number of core libraries in C
* SWIG to connect user libraries to Swift
